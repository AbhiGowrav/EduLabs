# Getting started with Datascience

## Overview

In this lab environment, you will be able to access the windows VM which has several popular tools for data exploration, analysis, modeling & development pre-installed.

## Instructions

1. Once the environment is provisioned, a virtual machine (JumpVM) on the left and lab guide on the right will get loaded in your browser. Use this virtual machine throughout the workshop to perform the lab.
