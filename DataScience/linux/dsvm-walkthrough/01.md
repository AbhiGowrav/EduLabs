## Task 2: Download the spambase dataset

In this task, you will download the [spambase](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/spambase) dataset which is a relatively small set of data that contains 4,601 examples. The dataset is a convenient size for demonstrating some of the key features of the DSVM because it keeps the resource requirements modest

1.  To download the data, open a terminal window, and then run this command:
    ```
    wget --no-check-certificate https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/spambase/spambase.data
    ```  
2. The downloaded file doesn't have a header row, Create another file that does have a header. 
   Run this command to create a file with the appropriate headers:
   ```
   echo 'word_freq_make, word_freq_address, word_freq_all, word_freq_3d,word_freq_our, word_freq_over, word_freq_remove, word_freq_internet,word_freq_order, word_freq_mail, word_freq_receive, word_freq_will,word_freq_people, word_freq_report, word_freq_addresses, word_freq_free,word_freq_business, word_freq_email, word_freq_you, word_freq_credit,word_freq_your, word_freq_font, word_freq_000, word_freq_money,word_freq_hp, word_freq_hpl, word_freq_george, word_freq_650, word_freq_lab,word_freq_labs, word_freq_telnet, word_freq_857, word_freq_data,word_freq_415, word_freq_85, word_freq_technology, word_freq_1999,word_freq_parts, word_freq_pm, word_freq_direct, word_freq_cs, word_freq_meeting,word_freq_original, word_freq_project, word_freq_re, word_freq_edu,word_freq_table, word_freq_conference, char_freq_semicolon, char_freq_leftParen,char_freq_leftBracket, char_freq_exclamation, char_freq_dollar, char_freq_pound, capital_run_length_average,capital_run_length_longest, capital_run_length_total, spam' > headers
   ```
   
3. Then, concatenate the two files together:
   ```
   cat spambase.data >> headers
   mv headers spambaseHeaders.data
   ```
   
   The dataset has several types of statistics for each email:
 - Columns like word_freq_WORD indicate the percentage of words in the email that match WORD. For example, if word_freq_make is 1, then 1% of all words in the email were  make.
 - Columns like char_freq_CHAR indicate the percentage of all characters in the email that are CHAR.
 - capital_run_length_longest is the longest length of a sequence of capital letters.
 - capital_run_length_average is the average length of all sequences of capital letters.
 - capital_run_length_total is the total length of all sequences of capital letters.
 - spam indicates whether the email was considered spam or not (1 = spam, 0 = not spam)
