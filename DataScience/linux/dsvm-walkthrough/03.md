## Task 3 : Train and test a machine learning model

In this task, Let's train a couple of machine learning models to classify the emails in the dataset as containing either spam or ham. In this section, we train a decision tree model and a random forest model. Then, we test the accuracy of the predictions

NOTE: The rpart (Recursive Partitioning and Regression Trees) package used in the following code is already installed on the DSVM.

1. First, let's split the dataset into training sets and test sets:
   ```
   rnd <- runif(dim(data)[1])
   trainSet = subset(data, rnd <= 0.7)
   testSet = subset(data, rnd > 0.7)
   ```
