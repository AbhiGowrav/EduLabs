## Task 3 : Train and test a machine learning model

In this task, Let's train a couple of machine learning models to classify the emails in the dataset as containing either spam or ham. In this section, we train a decision tree model and a random forest model. Then, we test the accuracy of the predictions

NOTE: The rpart (Recursive Partitioning and Regression Trees) package used in the following code is already installed on the DSVM.

1. First, let's split the dataset into training sets and test sets:
   ```
   rnd <- runif(dim(data)[1])
   trainSet = subset(data, rnd <= 0.7)
   testSet = subset(data, rnd > 0.7)
   ```
2. Then, create a decision tree to classify the emails:
   ```
   require(rpart)
   model.rpart <- rpart(spam ~ ., method = "class", data = trainSet)
   plot(model.rpart)
   text(model.rpart)
   ```
3. To determine how well it performs on the training set, use the following code:
   ```
   trainSetPred <- predict(model.rpart, newdata = trainSet, type = "class")
   t <- table(`Actual Class` = trainSet$spam, `Predicted Class` = trainSetPred)
   accuracy <- sum(diag(t))/sum(t)
   accuracy
   ```
4. To determine how well it performs on the test set:
   ```
   testSetPred <- predict(model.rpart, newdata = testSet, type = "class")
   t <- table(`Actual Class` = testSet$spam, `Predicted Class` = testSetPred)
   accuracy <- sum(diag(t))/sum(t)
   accuracy
   ```
5. Let's also try a random forest model. Random forests train a multitude of decision trees and output a class that's the mode of the classifications from all the individual decision trees. They provide a more powerful machine learning approach because they correct for the tendency of a decision tree model to overfit a training dataset.
   ```
   require(randomForest)
   trainVars <- setdiff(colnames(data), 'spam')
   model.rf <- randomForest(x=trainSet[, trainVars], y=trainSet$spam)

   trainSetPred <- predict(model.rf, newdata = trainSet[, trainVars], type = "class")
   table(`Actual Class` = trainSet$spam, `Predicted Class` = trainSetPred)

   testSetPred <- predict(model.rf, newdata = testSet[, trainVars], type = "class")
   t <- table(`Actual Class` = testSet$spam, `Predicted Class` = testSetPred)
   accuracy <- sum(diag(t))/sum(t)
   accuracy
   ```
