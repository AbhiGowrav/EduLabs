# Data science with an Ubuntu Data Science Virtual Machine in Azure

## Lab Overview

In this lab environment, you will access and explore the **Ubuntu DSVM** which has several popular tools for Data Exploration, Analysis, Modeling & Development pre-Installed.

You will complete several common data science tasks by using the Ubuntu Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM). The Ubuntu DSVM is a virtual machine image available in Azure that's preinstalled with a collection of tools commonly used for data analytics and machine learning.

The DSVM image makes it easy to get started doing data science in minutes, without having to install and configure each of the tools individually. You can easily stop it when it's not in use. The DSVM resource is both elastic and cost-efficient.

### JupyterLab
JupyterLab is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data. Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning. A modular design invites extensions to expand and enrich functionality.

### Jupyter Notebook
The Jupyter Notebook is the original web application for creating and sharing computational documents. It offers a simple, streamlined, document-centric experience.

### Explore the spambase dataset by using R Open
In this lab, you will also analyze the spambase dataset using R. Spambase is a set of emails that are marked either spam or ham (not spam). Spambase also contains some statistics about the content of the emails.

After completing this lab, you will learn how to:

- Log in to JupyterLab Portal
- Execute Notebooks
- Explore the spambase dataset by using R Open
- Train and test the machine learning model

## Instructions

### Getting started with the Lab environment

1. Once the environment is provisioned, an SSH session to the Linux virtual machine and lab guide will get loaded in your browser tab.

## Task 1: Log in to JupyterLab Portal

1. Let us start by logging into the JupyterLab Portal to check the resources deployed for the lab environment. Copy and paste the link below into a new tab in your browser.

   <inject key="Jupyter Lab Environment" enableCopy="true" />

1. On the page, you will see the warning Your connection isn't private, you can proceed by clicking on **Advanced** and then proceed to the URL mentioned.

1. On the page that loads up, enter the following username, password and click on **Sign in**. 

   * Username: <inject key="Jupyter Lab Username"></inject>

   * Password: <inject key="Jupyter Lab Password"></inject>

1. First-time users will be prompted **Server not running**, click on **Launch Server** and wait for 1-2 minutes for the server to start up.

1. Once the Jupyter Lab loads up, you will see the File System on the left and Launcher on the right. There are a lot of samples loaded up for the various technologies.

1. Within the ~/notebooks directory, you will find example notebooks that are pre-packaged for the various technologies. You can navigate through the notebooks and perform any exercise with the environment.

## Summary

In this exercise, you have signed in to the JupyterLab Portal and learnedÂ how to use Notebook to run the code and get the desired results.
