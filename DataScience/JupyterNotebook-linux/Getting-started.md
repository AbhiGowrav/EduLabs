# Getting started with Data Science Lab Environment


## Overview

In this lab environment, you will access the **Ubuntu VM** which has several popular tools for Data Exploration, Analysis, Modeling & Development Pre-Installed.

### JupyterLab
JupyterLab is a next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter.It is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data. Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning. A modular design invites extensions to expand and enrich functionality.

### Jupyter Notebook
The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. Its uses include data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.

After completing this, you will learn how to:

- Log in to JupyterLab Portal
- Execute Notebooks
