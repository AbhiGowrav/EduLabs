## Key concepts

Before you begin, here's a quick introduction to some key concepts:

**Node.js**: Node.js is a server-side JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code.

**npm**: The default package manager for Node.js is npm. A package manager makes it easier to publish and share Node.js source code libraries. The npm package manager simplifies library installation, updating, and uninstallation.

**React**: React is a front-end framework for creating a user interface (UI).

**JSX**: JSX is a JavaScript syntax extension typically used with React to describe UI elements. You must transpile JSX code to plain JavaScript before it can run in a browser.

**webpack**: Webpack bundles JavaScript files so they can run in a browser, and can also transform or package other resources and assets. Webpack can specify a compiler, such as Babel or TypeScript, to transpile JSX or TypeScript code to plain JavaScript.
