   In the Install New npm Packages dialog box, you can choose to install the most current package version or to specify a version. If you choose to install the current versions, but run into unexpected errors later, try installing the exact package versions listed in the next steps.

3. The **Output** window in the Visual Studio lower pane shows package installation progress. Open the **Output window** by selecting **View > Output** or pressing Ctrl+Alt+O.    In the Show output from field of the Output window, select **Npm**.

4. After the react package is installed verify that the react package appears under the **npm** node in **Solution Explorer**.

5. Instead of using the UI to search for and add the rest of the packages one at a time, you can paste the required package code into **package.json** file to install the required packages with the specified version, you will perform it in the next step.

6. From Solution Explorer, open **package.json** in the Visual Studio editor. Add the following **dependencies** section before the end of the file.If the file already has a dependencies section, replace it with the preceding JSON code
   
   ```
   "dependencies": {
   "express": "^4.17.1",
   "path": "^0.12.7",
   "react": "^17.0.2",
   "react-dom": "^17.0.2",
   "ts-loader": "^9.2.6",
   "typescript": "^4.5.2",
   "webpack": "^5.64.4",
   "webpack-cli": "^4.9.1"
   }
   ```
7. Press Ctrl+S or select **File->Save** to save the changes made to package.json file.

8. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **npm** node in your project and select **Install npm Packages**. This option runs the npm install command directly to install all the packages listed in **packages.json**.
