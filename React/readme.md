# Getting started with React app development

## Overview

In this lab environment, you will be able to access the windows VM with Visual studio pre-installed and develop React app.
You will learn how to:

- Create a Node.js project
- Add npm packages
- Add React code to your app
- Transpile JSX
- Attach the debugger and Run the App

## Instructions

1. Once the environment is provisioned, a virtual machine (JumpVM) on the left and lab guide on the right will get loaded in your browser. Use this virtual machine throughout the workshop to perform the lab.
