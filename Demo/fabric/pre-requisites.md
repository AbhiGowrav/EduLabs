The Fabric (Preview) trial lasts for a period of 60 days but may be extended by Microsoft, at our discretion.

## Create resources in Fabric

## Explore Fabric experiences

Fabric experiences refer to the different capabilities included in Fabric. You can switch between experiences using the experience switcher in the bottom left corner of the navigation pane.

You may notice that Fabric experiences look similar to other Microsoft data offerings. Fabric is built on Power BI and Azure Data Lake Storage, and includes capabilities from Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks, and Azure Machine Learning. What makes Fabric unique is that it brings these capabilities together in a single, SaaS, integrated experience without the need for access to Azure resources.
