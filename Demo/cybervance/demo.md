# CloudLabs Demo : Cybervance

## Overview
In this hands-on lab, you are provided with FLARE VM - a collection of software installation scripts for Windows systems that allows you to easily set up and maintain a reverse engineering environment on a virtual machine (VM). FLARE VM was designed to solve the problem of reverse engineering tool curation and relies on two main technologies: Chocolatey and Boxstarter
