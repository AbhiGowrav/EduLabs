# Task 2: View the Application Command Center(ACC)

## Overview

In this task, you can view the Application Command Center(ACC). This provides a detailed widget-based summary of the applications, and the default time is 1 hour. With the help of **Application Command Center(ACC)**, you can view the contextual linkage between the application and the content which allows you to make more security decisions.

The default view of **ACC** will show the network, threat, blocked, and tunnel activity in four separate tabs. The time frame and each tab can be customized to display the relevant application, and threat, and can view the user activity depending upon the user role.
