## Overview

Azure Application Gateway is a web traffic load balancer that enables you to manage traffic to your web applications. Traditional load balancers operate at the transport layer (OSI layer 4 - TCP and UDP) and route traffic based on source IP address and port, to a destination IP address and port. Incoming application traffic is distributed across different backend pools, including Azure VMs, virtual machine scale sets, Azure App Service, and on-premises/external servers.
