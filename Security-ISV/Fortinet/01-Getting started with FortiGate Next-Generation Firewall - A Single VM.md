## Overview

The FortiGate firewall enables enterprises to control their resources and applications in Microsoft Azure. FortiGate-VM offers a consistent security posture and protects connectivity across public and private clouds, while high-speed VPN connections protect data. This single FortiGate-VM setup is a basic setup to start exploring the capabilities of the next generation firewall. The central system will receive, using user-defined routing (UDR), all or specific traffic that needs inspection going to/coming from on-prem networks or the public internet.
