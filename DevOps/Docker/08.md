### Exercise 6: Working with Docker Volumes

Docker has two options for containers to store files in the host machine, so that the files are persisted even after the container stops: volumes, and bind mounts.

- **Volumes**: Created and managed by Docker. Volumes are stored in a part of the host filesystem, managed by Docker (/var/lib/docker/volumes/ on Linux). Non-Docker processes should not modify this part of the filesystem. 

   When you create a volume, it is stored within a directory on the Docker host. When you mount the volume into a container, this directory is what is mounted into the container. This is similar to the way that bind mounts work, except that volumes are managed by Docker and are isolated from the core functionality of the host machine.
   
- **Bind mounts**: Bind mounts may be stored anywhere on the host system. They may even be important system files or directories. Non-Docker processes on the Docker host or a Docker container can modify them at any time.
   
   When we use a bind mount, a file or directory on the host machine is mounted into a container. The file or directory is referenced by its full path on the host machine. The file or directory does not need to exist on the Docker host already. It is created on-demand if it does not yet exist.

In this exercise, you will learn how to create volumes in docker, how to mount a volume to a container and share volumes with the containers.

1. Create a new volume by running the below command. Docker automatically creates a directory for the volume on the host under the **`/var/lib/docker/volume/path`**.

   - docker volume create volume_name 

     ```
     docker volume create myvol1
     ```
     ![](./images/dock36.png "SSMS Toolbar")
   
2. In your terminal **run** the following command to list the volumes and verify your volume is listed.

    ```
    docker volume list
    ```
   
   ![](./images/dock37.png "SSMS Toolbar")
   
3. Now **create** a Docker container with the **Ubuntu** base Image and mount the **myvol1** volume to that container.

   ```
   docker run -it  -v myvol1:/shared-volume --name vol-container-01 ubuntu
   ```
   ![](./images/dock38.png "SSMS Toolbar")
   
4. Inside the container **create** a file and add content to the file.

   ```
   ls
   cd /shared-volume
   echo "This is volume1 file" > volume.txt
   ```

   ![](./images/dock39.png "SSMS Toolbar")
   
   
5. Run **`ls`** and verify your file exists and exit the container.

   ```
   ls
   exit
   ```
   
6. Create another Docker container called **vol-container-01** and mount the same Docker volume called **myvol1** inside the container.


   ```
   docker run -it  -v myvol1:/shared-volume --name vol-container-02 ubuntu
   ```
   
 
7. Now inside the new container navigate to the **shared-volume** directory and list the files. You will find the **file1.txt** file that you had created in the same volume but mounted in **my-container-01** earlier and it also has the same content inside it. This is because the volume is shared among the two containers.
   
   ```
   ls
   ```
