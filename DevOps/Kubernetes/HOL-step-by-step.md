## Overview

Kubernetes is an open-source system for managing containerized applications across multiple hosts in a cluster. Kubernetes provides mechanisms for application deployment, scheduling, updating, maintenance, and scaling.

The following are the core concepts of Kubernetes:
   - **Containers** - A container image is a ready-to-run software package, containing everything needed to run an application.
   - **Nodes** - A Node is a worker machine in Kubernetes and may be either a virtual or a physical machine, depending on the cluster.
   - **Pods** - A Pod is a group of one or more containers, with shared storage and network resources, and a specification for how to run the containers. 
   - **Labels** - Labels are key/value pairs that are attached to objects, such as pods.
   - **Services** - Service is an abstraction which defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them.


Kubernetes aids in ensuring that containerized applications execute where and when you want them to, as well as assisting them in locating the resources and tools they require.
