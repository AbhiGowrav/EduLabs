# Getting Started with Kubernetes


## Overview

In this lab environment, you'll be able to use the Ubuntu VM which comes with preloaded images of Minikube. This flexibility enables you to try out Kubernetes deployments, perform development tasks, or test configurations easily. Minikube is especially useful for those new to kubernetes since it enables you to gain familiarity with basic concepts.
