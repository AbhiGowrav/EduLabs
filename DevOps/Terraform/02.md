# Exercise 2: Create Virtual Network using Terraform

In this exercise, you will create a Virtual Network using Terraform and modify your configuration by defining an additional resource that references your resource group and adding tags to your resource group.


## Task 1: Create Virtual Network using Terraform

In this task, you will create a Virtual Network using Terraform within the resource group which you have imported into the Terraform state in the previous exercise.
   
1. Now, minimize the Powershell window and navigate to the path **C:\learn-terraform-azure** in the file explorer.

1. In your **main.tf** file, copy and paste the resource block given below to create a virtual network (VNet) and save the file.

   ```
     # Create a virtual network
     resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "vnet" {
       name                = "vnet-terraform-prod-westus2-001"
       address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
       location            = "westus2"
       resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
     }
    ```
    > **Info**: To create a new Azure VNet, you have to specify the name of the resource group to contain the VNet. By referencing the resource group, you establish a dependency between the resources. Terraform ensures that resources are created in proper order by constructing a dependency graph for your configuration.

1. Run the below command to create an execution plan, which lets you to preview the changes that Terraform plans to make to your infrastructure. 

    ```
      terraform plan -out=FILE
    ```
    
    > **Info :**  In the above command you are using **-out=FILE** option to save the generated plan to a file on disk. If you run ```terraform plan``` without the ```-out=FILE``` option, the system will then generate a speculative plan, which is a description of the plan's effect but does not intend to implement it.

1. After updating the configuration, run the below command to apply the changes to your infrastructure.  Enter **yes** to the prompt to confirm the changes.

    ```
      terraform apply
    ```
    ![vnet](../Terraform/media/vnetnew.png)
  
    > **Info**: Terraform builds an execution plan by comparing your desired state as described in the configuration to the current state, which is saved in either the local terraform.tfstate file or a remote state backend depending on your configuration.

1. You have successfully created a Virtual network using Terraform.

1. To validate the Virtual network, navigate back to the **Azure Portal** and click on **Resource groups** from Navigate panel.

    ![navigate](../Terraform/media/navigate.png)

1. On the **Resource groups** tab, click on **lab-rg-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**.

1. Now, under **Resources**, you should be able to see the newly created Virtual Network **vnet-terraform-prod-westus2-001**.

    ![myvnet](../Terraform/media/vnetprod.png)
    
    > **Note**: You may have to refresh the page to see the newly created Virtual Network.
    
1. You can minimize the windows browser before moving to the next task.


## Task 2: Modify an existing resource

Terraform also supports the modification of existing resources along with the creation of new resources. In this task, you will be adding the tags to the existing resource group.

1. Now, again navigate to your **main.tf** file, and update the **azurerm_resource_group** resource in your configuration by adding the tags block as shown below:

   >**Note:** make sure you replace **DID** value under resource group name with **<inject key="DeploymentID" />** and save the file.

   ```
     resource "azurerm_resource_group" "rg" {
       name     = "lab-rg-{DID}"
       location = "westus2"

       tags = {
         Environment = "Terraform Getting Started"
         Team = "DevOps"
       }
     }
    ```
    
1. Run the below command to create an execution plan, which lets you to preview the changes that Terraform plans to make to your infrastructure. 

    ```
      terraform plan -out=FILE
    ```
    
    > **Info :**  In the above command you are using **-out=FILE** option to save the generated plan to a file on disk, which you can later execute by passing the file to terraform apply as an extra argument. 


1. Run the below command to modify your infrastructure and enter **yes** to the prompt to confirm the operation.

   ```
    terraform apply
   ```
   ![vnet update](../Terraform/media/tag.png)
   
   > **Info:** The prefix ~ means that Terraform will update the resource in place.

1. Run the below command to see the new values associated with this resource group.

    ```
      terraform show
    ```
     ![vnet show](../Terraform/media/vnetshow.png)
     
1. Run the below command to get the updated list of resources managed in your workspace.

   ```
     terraform state list
   ```
   ![vnet list](../Terraform/media/vnet%20list.png)
   

## Summary

In this exercise, you have covered the following:

  - Created Virtual Network using Terraform
  - Modified the existing resource
