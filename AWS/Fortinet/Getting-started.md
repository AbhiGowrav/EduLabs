# Getting started with Fortinet FortiGate Next-Generation Firewall

## Overview

The Fortinet FortiGate Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) combines security and networking services to enable both content and network protection in 
an Amazon Web Services (AWS) environment. Fortinet designed this solution to inspect traffic as it enters and leaves the network, while simultaneously 
providing integrated security capabilities. The FortiGate NGFW can enable these security features without degrading performance and adversely affecting 
the end-user experience.

The FortiGate NGFW is part of the broader Fortinet Security Fabric architecture, designed to provide broad visibility and control of an organizationâ€™s
entire digital attack surface and automated operations, orchestration, and response. AI/ML, along with continuous threat intelligence provided by 
FortiGuard Labs security services, help to create and automate policies driving how the FortiGate NGFW responds to evolving threats.
