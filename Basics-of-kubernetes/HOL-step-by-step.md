# Exercise 1: Basics of Kubernetes

## Overview

Kubernetes is an open-source system for managing containerized applications across multiple hosts in a cluster. Kubernetes provides mechanisms for application deployment, scheduling, updating, maintenance, and scaling.

The following are the core concepts of Kubernetes:
   - **Containers** - A container image is a ready-to-run software package, containing everything needed to run an application.
   - **Nodes** - A Node is a worker machine in Kubernetes and may be either a virtual or a physical machine, depending on the cluster.
   - **Pods** - A Pod is a group of one or more containers, with shared storage and network resources, and a specification for how to run the containers. 
   - **Labels** - Labels are key/value pairs that are attached to objects, such as pods.
   - **Services** - Service is an abstraction which defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them.
