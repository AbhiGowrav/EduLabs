Exercise:Set up a lab for big data analytics using Docker deployment of HortonWorks Data Platform
This lab will guide you on how to set up a big data analytics class. With this type of class, students learn how to handle large volumes of data and apply machine and statistical learning algorithms to derive data insights. A key objective for students is to learn to use data analytics tools, such as Apache Hadoop's open-source software package which provides tools for storing, managing, and processing big data.

In this lab, students will use a popular commercial version of Hadoop provided by Cloudera, called Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP). Specifically, students will use HDP Sandbox 3.0.1 which is a simplified, easy-to-use version of the platform that is free of cost and intended for learning and experimentation. Although this class may use either Windows or Linux virtual machines (VM) with HDP Sandbox deployed, this article will show how to use Windows.

Another interesting aspect of this lab, is that we will deploy HDP Sandbox on the lab VMs using Docker containers. Each Docker container provides its own isolated environment for software applications to run inside. Conceptually, Docker containers are like nested VMs and can be used to easily deploy and run a wide variety of software applications based on container images provided on Docker Hub. Cloudera's deployment script for HDP Sandbox automatically pulls the HDP Sandbox 3.0.1 Docker image from Docker Hub and runs two Docker containers:

sandbox-hdp
sandbox-proxy
